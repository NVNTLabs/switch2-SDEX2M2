# NVNT's SDEX2M2 (MicroSD Express to M.2) Adapter Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679e10da-82e8-4d7a-8257-d86a05efd59d)

SDEX2M2 (Micro**SD** **Ex**press to **M2**) is an adapter for the Nintendo Switch 2 which converts the MicroSD Express slot to a NVME M.2 (M-Key) slot. Think MicroSD Express cards are difficult to find or expensive? Looking to expand your storage for cheaper? Just use the NVME M.2 SSD that you have, and/or can easily find! The project is open source hardware under the GPLv3 License.

This project also encompasses the sister-project of "MicroSD Express to SD Express" adapter, which is a pin-to-pin conversion kit allowing full size SD Express cards to be used on the Nintendo Switch 2.

## How is this possible?

This is possible because the Nintendo Switch 2's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a **true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface** and utilizes the **NVMe protocol** for communication.

This adapter simply maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2’s MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD. After further research and review from users, an onboard mcu/fpga will be required for the handshake provess with the Switch 2.

- ✅ Create Schematic for PCB layout
- ✅ Create Dummy MicroSD Express Card V2
- ✅ Create M.2 Breakout for prototyping (Updated 2-layer PCB)
- ✅ Create MicroSD Express Breakout Board V0.1 (Updated 2-layer PCB)
- ✅ Create MicroSD Express to SD Express Adapter (Experimental, Updated 2-layer PCB)
- ✅ Create BOM for fabrication and sourcing (WIP)
- ✅ Create MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Pin to Pin Adapter (Proof of concept)
- ✅ Create basic 3D printable enclosures/shells for the PCBs
- 🔲 Create MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Adapter with FPGA/MCU Proto (for handshake with Nintendo Switch 2) **(in progress)**
- ✅ Create MicroSD Express to Flex Cable Adapter
- 🔲 Create Flex Cable to NVMe Adapter **(in progress)**
- 🔲 Create MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Dock **(in progress)**

## Status

Work in progress. Currently, a prototype with handshake capability with the Switch 2 and also designs for the final product design are being worked on.

An early proof of concept prototype of the SDEX2M2 MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Adapter has been made, but it does lack Switch 2 compatibility. 

For prototyping, production-ready 2-layer PCBs for the MicroSD Express breakout board, NVMe breakout board, and the MicroSD Express to FPC Connector (which may be used in the final design) have been uploaded.

The MicroSD Express to SD Express adapter production ready prototype board has been uploaded as well, for users with full-size SD Express cards.

Basic 3D printable shells have been added too, for convenience.

## Warnings

- Use at your own risk. We are **not liable** for any damage to your drive, Switch 2, or other devices.
- Only use **low-voltage, low-power M.2 2230 NVMe drives**.
- **Do not use this in legacy MicroSD slots** (e.g., original Nintendo Switch).
