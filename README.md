# NVNT's SDEX2M2 (MicroSD Express to M.2) Adapter Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/657212a5-0e45-479e-ab5f-9b9b10adbf6a)

SDEX2M2 (Micro**SD** **Ex**press to **M2**) is an adapter for the Nintendo Switch 2 which converts the MicroSD Express slot to a NVME M.2 (M-Key) slot. Think MicroSD Express cards are difficult to find or expensive? Looking to expand your storage for cheaper? Just use the NVME M.2 SSD that you have, and/or can easily find! The project is open source hardware under the GPLv3 License.

This project also encompasses the sister-project of "MicroSD Express to SD Express" adapter, which is a pin-to-pin conversion kit allowing full size SD Express cards to be used on the Nintendo Switch 2.

## How is this possible?

This is possible because the Nintendo Switch 2's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a **true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface** and utilizes the **NVMe protocol** for communication.

This adapter simply maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2‚Äôs MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD. After further research and review from users, an onboard mcu will be required for the handshake provess with the Switch 2.

Currently, a MicroSD Express breakbout is being developed to start this process.

## Goals

- ‚úÖ Create Pinout & Pin Definitions (UPDATED!)
- ‚úÖ Create Footprints for MicroSD Express
- ‚úÖ Create Schematic for PCB layout
- ‚úÖ Create Dummy MicroSD Express Card V2
- üî≤ Create M.2 Breakout for prototyping
- üî≤ Create Dummy MicroSD Express card with breakout for prototyping
- üî≤ Create MicroSD Express to SD Express Adapter
- üî≤ Create routed PCB with Gerber/Drill files
- ‚úÖ Create BOM for fabrication and sourcing
- üî≤ (Optional) Offload VDD externally for higher-power drives
- üî≤ Produce & Test

## Status

Work in progress. Currently, a M.2 breakout board and MicroSD Express breakout board are being designed, then produced. Files and BOM will be updated accordingly when available. 

There is still the possibility that there are power-related issues (ie: power draw of M.2 drives is more than the Switch 2 can push out).

## Warnings

- Use at your own risk. We are **not liable** for any damage to your drive, Switch 2, or other devices.
- Only use **low-voltage, low-power M.2 2230 NVMe drives**.
- **Do not use this in legacy MicroSD slots** (e.g., original Nintendo Switch).
- This project is for **accessibility/educational use only**.  No commercial or piracy use permitted.

The optional resistor is for the PERST# lane, may help with state when idle. Not sure if needed until prototyping commences.

Still a WIP. Some discrepencies may exist.
