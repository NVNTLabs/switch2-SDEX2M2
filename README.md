# NVNT's SDEX2M2 (MicroSD Express to M.2) Adapter Project

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/679e10da-82e8-4d7a-8257-d86a05efd59d)

SDEX2M2 (Micro**SD** **Ex**press to **M2**) is an adapter for the Nintendo Switch 2 which converts the MicroSD Express slot to a NVME M.2 (M-Key) slot. Think MicroSD Express cards are difficult to find or expensive? Looking to expand your storage for cheaper? Just use the NVME M.2 SSD that you have, and/or can easily find! The project is open source hardware under the GPLv3 License.

This project also encompasses the sister-project of "MicroSD Express to SD Express" adapter, which is a pin-to-pin conversion kit allowing full size SD Express cards to be used on the Nintendo Switch 2.

## How is this possible?

This is possible because the Nintendo Switch 2's MicroSD Express slot supports the SD Express 7.1 standard, which exposes a **true PCIe Gen3 x1 interface** and utilizes the **NVMe protocol** for communication.

This adapter simply maps PCIe x1 from the Switch 2â€™s MicroSD Express slot to a standard M.2 2230 NVMe SSD. After further research and review from users, an onboard mcu/fpga will be required for the handshake provess with the Switch 2.

## Goals

- âœ… Create Pinout & Pin Definitions (UPDATED!)
- âœ… Create Footprints for MicroSD Express
- âœ… Create Schematic for PCB layout
- âœ… Create Dummy MicroSD Express Card V2
- âœ… Create M.2 Breakout for prototyping (Updated 2-layer PCB)
- âœ… Create MicroSD Express Breakout Board V0.1 (Updated 2-layer PCB)
- âœ… Create MicroSD Express to SD Express Adapter (Experimental, Updated 2-layer PCB)
- âœ… Create BOM for fabrication and sourcing (WIP)
- âœ… Create MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Pin to Pin Adapter (Proof of concept)
- ðŸ”² Create MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Adapter with FPGA/MCU Proto (for handshake with Nintendo Switch 2)

## Status

Work in progress. 

Currently, an early proof of concept prototype of the SDEX2M2 MicroSD Express to NVMe M.2 SSD Adapter has been made. 

Additionally, production-ready (hopefully!) 2-layer PCBs for the MicroSD Express breakout board, and the NVMe breakout board have been uploaded.

The MicroSD Express to SD Express (full size) adapter production ready board has been uploaded too.

## Warnings

- Use at your own risk. We are **not liable** for any damage to your drive, Switch 2, or other devices.
- Only use **low-voltage, low-power M.2 2230 NVMe drives**.
- **Do not use this in legacy MicroSD slots** (e.g., original Nintendo Switch).
